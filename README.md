# DecisionTree
# Decision Tree Algorithm Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm for solving classification and regression problems. A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that splits data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions. It is widely used for its simplicity and interpretability in various machine learning tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can vary based on the task (classification or regression). For classification, datasets like the Iris dataset or any custom dataset with labeled categories can be used. For regression, datasets with continuous target variables are suitable.

### Features (Classification Example)
- **Feature 1**: The first feature of the dataset.
- **Feature 2**: The second feature of the dataset.
- **Target**: The class label or category.

### Features (Regression Example)
- **Feature 1**: The first feature of the dataset.
- **Feature 2**: The second feature of the dataset.
- **Target**: The continuous value being predicted.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Project Structure
```
|-- dataset.csv           # CSV file containing the dataset
|-- decision_tree.py      # Python script implementing the Decision Tree model
|-- README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, and relevant features are selected for training. Categorical data is encoded, and missing values are handled.
3. **Model Training**: A Decision Tree model is trained using the `DecisionTreeClassifier` (for classification) or `DecisionTreeRegressor` (for regression) class from the `scikit-learn` library.
4. **Prediction**: The model predicts the target values for the test data.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall (for classification), or Mean Squared Error and R-squared (for regression).

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd decision-tree-project
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python decision_tree.py
   ```

## Example Output
For classification tasks, the output will include the predicted class labels along with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. For regression tasks, the output will include predicted continuous values and performance metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error.

## Visualization
If enabled, the script can generate visualizations such as:
- The decision tree structure (using `plot_tree` from `scikit-learn`).
- Feature importance graphs.
- For classification tasks: decision boundaries in 2D.
- For regression tasks: comparison of actual vs predicted values.
